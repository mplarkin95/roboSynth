Robotics Project synthesizer

Basic robot synthesizer prototype.  Robot listens to audio input (solo part) and creates an improvised in key chord progression.  Plays chord progression until it detects a key change.  Randomly switches between argpegiation and straight chords and keeps itself in rythm to a set beat-per-minute setting.
